                        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left pull-left"></i>Sam is a very kind, caring and passionate individual. Her work as a doula goes beyond what you expect with her constant care and consideration for your personal circumstances. I myself am currently expecting my 3rd child and I feel very confident in my birth plan decisions due to the support, advice and encouragement I have received from Sam! The talks that Sam facilitates are also a great help to meet other parents and gain great advice and knowledge. It's also a great way to meet others that also have an input in easing the transition and gaining knowledgable advice. I'm very happy to have this level of support and would recommend Sam to anyone. Thank you Sam x</p><p><small>Emma Burns</small></p>

                        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left pull-left"></i>I attended a positive birth meeting that Sam facilitated after being recommended by a friend. I am currently on my third pregnancy and after two instances of preeclampsia I have been very anxious this time around. Sam was very understanding and gave me good practical advice as well as a sense of empowerment that I could trust my body. She lent me a book by AIMS entitled "I am allowed" (the title sums it up) and it was such an interesting and insightful read. I can honestly say that since meeting Sam and the lovely women at that meeting I have been much more in control of my anxiety and have enjoyed the pregnancy more. I am very grateful to her and hope to engage with her more throughout the next few months.</p><p><small>Lisa Barry</small></p>

                        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left pull-left"></i>Sam attended my home birth. She was wonderful. She made it her priority to look after me so that I could look after the baby and my partner could relax and be there for our older daughter. A natural facilitator, Sam has a knack for being able to recognise the needs of the mother and unobtrusively meet those needs. By doing so the mother is empowered to be who she needs to be. It is so good to see a natural passion employed so aptly, and someone work with such dedication and selflessness. Thank you Sam, for everything xxx</p><p><small>Kristina Young</small></p>
